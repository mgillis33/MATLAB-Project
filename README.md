# Traffic Project

This project runs a statistical analysis on the amount of pedestrians and vehicles crossing through an intersection depending on the time (see traffic.m).
It also creates an app (traffic.mlapp) that displays barcharts of the number of vehicles/pedestrians crossing the intersection corresponding to the time, while displaying a selected measure of center and spread.
